## Credits

Pulled README from Pre-Work-Study-Guide in my own repositories.
Used activity code from gitlab repository to reference best practices for using web API's for appending new data and for showing and hiding data at different times, also used these activity codes to form my functions and loops so that the code could operate properly. Used MDN as a resource to understand how web API's function and what kinds of tools I had at my disposal so that I could accomplish a page that generates new questions and only displays the current question or screen that I want users to see. Also used MDN as a reference for how eventListners function so that each button could function properly within each question. Cooperated with the TA Walter to get past a bug I encountered where scores were not adding up correctly.
